A few specs and observartions about this project:

 - This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

 - Project created for a yoga studio, centered around displaying beautiful images and taking advantage of modular design to easily add new sections or pages. 

 - Feel free to replicate parts of this project that you may find useful. These could be the image galleryâ€”built with Swiper.js, or the newsletter signup frontend & backend if you wish to use MailerLite's API and Netlify functions to create custom forms in your Next.js project. 

 - If you're a first time user of MailerLite, make sure you verify and authenticate your domain before you test your newsletter signup, otherwise it won't work. [Here](https://www.mailerlite.com/help/how-to-verify-and-authenticate-your-domain) are the steps to do that.
 
 - The newsletter also won't work in dev mode. So if you're not sure if it behaves as expected or not, instead of deploying it straight away on Netlify, [install the Netlify CLI](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/12/12/how-to-test-serverless-functions-locally/) and use it to test your form locally. 

 - Please note that the newsletter on this [live page](https://awakenyogastudio.netlify.app/) is neither connected to a MailerLite account, nor forms are enabled in Netlify, so don't input emails as they won't pass through. 

 - Also, parts of the styling have been removed as the purpose of open sourcing this project is to show its structure and logic rather than creating an website template. Please do not use the web copy for business purposes.
